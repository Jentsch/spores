# Spores

[![Build Status](https://platform-ci.scala-lang.org/api/badges/jvican/spores-spark/status.svg)](https://platform-ci.scala-lang.org/jvican/spores-spark)

Scala Spores, safe mobile closures: [SIP-21](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/spores.html).

This is a [Scala Center project](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/master/proposals/006-compile-time-serializibility-check.md)
promoted and voted by the Advisory Board.

This work is part of an *ongoing* effort to create a production-ready version
of spores compatible with Spark and Java serialization. The Scala Center is currently
behind its development based on the IBM proposal in September's Advisory Board meeting.

Heather Miller and Philipp Haller are the original authors of the idea and the creators
of the initial implementation this project is based on. For more information on the
underlying theory of spores, check the
[SIP proposal](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/spores.html) and the
paper [Spores: A Type-Based Foundation for Closures in the Age of Concurrency and Distribution](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/191239/files/spores_1.pdf).
